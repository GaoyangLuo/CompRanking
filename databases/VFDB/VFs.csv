The Tir-like effector protein Tarp might function as a receptor for an unidentified chlamydial intimin analog and mediate the recruitment of actin to the C. trachomatis inclusion. Tarp is activated upon tyrosine phosphorylation by an unidentfied eukaryotic kinase.

The subtypes can differ up to 36% on the amino acid level within a given serotype. So far, more than 40 subtypes have been described in the literature.;  BoNT/A, B, E, F induce botulism in humans, BoNT/C and D and their mosaic variants CD and DC induce botulism in animals, BoNT/G has not been clearly assigned to a natural outbreak in humans or  animals;Additionally, several novel BoNT molecules have been pronounced: BoNT/HA (also called BoNT/FA or BoNT/H) which was involved in an infant botulism case and has been characterised as a novel mosaic type toxin and BoNT/X, both produced or encoded by C. botulinum, as well as eBoNT/J (aka BoNT/En) encoded by Enterococcus faecium; BoNTs associate with non-toxic clostridial proteins to form large, stable complexes that exist in cultures known as progenitor toxins. These progenitor toxins comprise three different forms: 12S (C 300 kDa), 16S (C 500 kDa), and 19S (C 900 kDa), and consist of neurotoxin subunits coupled with one or more non-toxic components known as neurotoxin associated proteins (NAPs). NAPs possess hemagglutinin activity (HA) protect the neurotoxin from harsh environment inside host like low pH and proteases, and include HA-17, HA-22, HA-33, and HA-55.","BoNT is initially synthesized as a 150 kDa single-chain protein that is post-translationally nicked to form a dichain structure. The nicked neurotoxin consists of a 100 kDa heavy chain and a 50 kDa light chain (Zinc metalloprotease) linked by a disulfide bridge. The crystal structure of BoNT indicates that the heavy chain consists of a receptor binding domain (HC) and a translocation domain (HN), while the light chain contains a catalytic domain (LC).; PDB code: 3BTA, 1EPW","BoNTs are metalloproteinases that enter peripheral cholinergic nerve terminals, where they cleave one or two of the three core proteins of the neuroexocytosis apparatus and elicit persistent but reversible inhibition of neurotransmitter release.; BoNT also serves as a remarkably effective treatment for involuntary muscle disorders such as blepharospasm, strabismus, hemifacial spasm, certain types of spasticity in children, and other ailments.","The BoNT mechanism of action consists of four sequential steps:; I. rapid and specific binding to the cholinergic nerve terminal membrane; II. internalization inside a vesicle endowed with an ATPase proton pump;  III. membrane translocation triggered by acidification of the vesicular lumen, which causes a structural rearrangement with membrane insertion of the toxin and translocation of the L-chain into the cytosol;  IV. expression of the L-chain proteolytic activity against specific substrates.; Receptors for BoNTs are composed of both gangliosides that bind toxins with low affinity and protein receptors that form high-affinity complexes with toxins. Synaptotagmins I and II, two homologous synaptic vesicle proteins, have been shown to function in conjunction with gangliosides to mediate entry of BoNT/B into cells. Low-affinity interactions between BoNT/A and gangliosides have also been reported. Recent studies have indicated that the synaptic vesicle protein SV2 acts as the protein receptor for BoNT/A.; BoNT light chains were identified as having zinc-dependent protease activity and to specifically target a group of proteins known as SNAREs.;The L-chains of the seven BoNTs are remarkably specific proteases:;  BoNT/B, /D, /F and /G cleave only synaptic vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP) at single sites, which results in VAMP losing most of its cytosolic domain.; BoNT/A and /E cleave only 25 kDa synaptosomal-associated protein (SNAP-25) at single individual sites within its C-teminus.;  BoNT/C cleaves both SNAP-25 and syntaxin.",Abstract(s) in PubMed

And s1/m1 strains are more toxic than s1/m2 strains","Proteolytic cleavage of the VacA protoxin (140 kDa) at its N and C termini yields a 33-aa signal sequence, a mature 90-kDa secreted protein, and a C-terminal fragment that remains localized in the bacterial cell; the secreted protein is structured in two distinct parts. First, amino-terminal 37-kDa region, rich in <beta>-pleated sheets. This region begins with a 32-residue hydrophobic segment with a propensity to insert into membranes, and ends with a protease-sensitive segment. Second, the following 58-kDa part is predicted to consist of two domains, separated by a flexible segment of variable length: the first domain is highly conserved, whereas the second one is genetically considerably diverse.",,"The secreted VacA toxin oligomerized into rosettes. It binds to the apical portion of epithelial cells and inserts into the plasma membrane, forming a hexameric anion-selective channel of low conductance. These channels are release bicarbonate and organic anions from the cell cytosol to support bacterial growth. The toxin channels are slowly endocytosed and eventually reach late endosomal compartment, increasing their permeability to anions with enhancements of the electrogenic vacuolar ATPase (vATPase) proton pump. In the presence of weak bases, including the ammonia generated by the Helicobacter pylori urease, osmotically active acidotropic ions will accumulate in the endosomes. This leads to water influx and vesicle swelling, and essential step in vacuole formation. By an as-yet-unidentified mechanism, the VacA toxin alters tight junctions and increases the paracellular route of permeability providing iron, nickel and other nutrients, this TER (trans-epithelial resistance) effect of VacA could be mediated through specific interaction with the recently identified cytosolic protein VIP54.; VacA is the first bacterial virulence factor that exploits the important plasma membrane sphingolipid, sphingomyelin (SM), as a cellular receptor.",Abstract(s) in PubMed

Its 11 genes are located on a genomic-island-like region. It might play a role in the efficiency of host cell infection by L. pneumophila grown at lower temperatures. However, the specific substrates of this system have not yet been identified.","Majority of the dot/icm genes are predicted to encode membrane-associated proteins ;DotA is an integral cytoplasmic membrane protein with 8 membrane-spanning domains; IcmK and IcmB proteins are on bacterial surface; IcmQ, IcmS, IcmR, IcmW located in the bacterial cytoplasm; IcmS, IcmW, IvgA are chaperons; IcmX are periplasmic protein; RalF structure: 1XSZ","Allows survival and growth in macrophages, prevent phagosome acidification and lysosome fusion, essential for induction of apoptosis in human macrophages","Assemble and activate a type IV secretion system in the bacterial membrane that exports plasmid and virulence factors to inhibit the phago-lysosome fusion and reprogram the Legionella-bearing vacuole; IcmS was shown to bind members of the SidE family (SidE, SdeA, SdeB, SdeC) and to be required for the export of SdeA; IcmW interacted with and was required for the translocation of additional Dot/Icm substrates, including SidG, SidH, WipA and WipB; LvgA directly interacts with IcmS; Dot/Icm secretion substrates have been identified:; DotA, a protein that was originally reported to assemble as a polytopic protein in the inner membrane of L. pneumophila cells. It may form a pore in the eukaryotic membrane for the passage of other effectors; LidA (low viability in the presence of dot), a protein translocated to the phagosome membrane. It regulates Dot/Icm assembly and is thought to be one of the first translocated substrates. It is postulated to function in vesicle recruitment during the biogenesis of the replication vacuole; RalF, an exchange factor for the ADP ribosylation factor protein (ARF) family of GTPases. It is required for the localization of ARF on phagosomes containing L. pneumophila. ARF is important for biogenesis of the replicative organelle; DrrA (defect in Rab1 recruitment A, also known as SidM), is a multifunction enzyme with both GDF (GDI-displacement factor, GDI: guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor) and GEF (guanine nucleotide exchange factor) activities. DrrA has the intrinsic ability to bind to the cytosolic surface of the plasma membrane. Because the L. pneumophila-containing vacuole (LCV is) initially a plasma-membrane-derived organelle, translocated DrrA protein associates with the immature LCV formed on bacterial internalization. The GDF activity of DrrA promotes the sampling of cytosolic Rab proteins associated with Rab GDI. When Rab1-Rab-GDI complexes are sampled, the removal of Rab GDI permits the GEF domain in DrrA to activate Rab1, leading to the stable association of Rab1 with the LCV membrane. Active Rab1 facilitates organization of the LCV membrane to promote the delivery and fusion of ER-derived vesicles. DrrA cycles off because the composition of the vacuole membrane changes.; LepB is a Rab1-specific GAP (GTPase-activating proteins). The LepB protein accumulates on the LCV membrane and the GAP activity facilitates the removal of Rab1 by stimulating GTP hydrolysis. The removal of Rab1 coincides with fusion of the LCV with the host ER and replication of L. pneumophila in a vacuole containing ER proteins.; Other candidate effector proteins including SidA-G (substrate of Dot/Icm transporter), Vips (VPS(vacuole protein sorting) inhibitor proteins, VipA, VipD, VipE, VipF), SdeA-D, YlfAB (yeast lethal factor A and B), their real function are unknown; Once the vacuole provides conditions for the bacteria to grow, functional genes of the dot/icm family become dispensable",Abstract(s) in PubMed

VopL mediated actin assembly occurs in a manner that is independent of any other eukaryotic factor.; VopA effector is a member of a family of type III effectors called YopJ-like proteins that are found in a wide variety of pathogens. YopJ was demonstrated to inhibit the MAPK and NF-<kappa>B signaling pathways by acetylating the critical serine and threonine residues found on the activation loop of MAPKkinases (MKKs), thereby blocking their activation by phosphorylation. VopA and YopJ share ~55% similarity at the amino acid level. VopA is also an acetyltranferase. VopA inhibits MAPK signaling using a novel mechanism. This effector acetylates a conserved lysine located in the catalytic loop of all kinases that plays a critical role in the binding of the <gamma>-phosphate of ATP.
